# Dam-Flow-Prediction
Forecasting Dam Flow using machine learning and deep learning
in this project, we tried to predict the flow of a dam in IRAN (in the case study Zayanderood Dam)
we used time series data of the dam and extracted some handcrafted features then employed some machine learning models (SVM, KNN and Deep feedforward neural network)
